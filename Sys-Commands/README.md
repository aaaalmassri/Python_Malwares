Author: Abdelrahman Adel Almorssy
Date: June 15, 2023
Description: This script demonstrates how to steal passwords from a target machine and send them back to an attacker's machine.

## Summary

This Python script is designed to install a malware file and execute it on a target Windows machine to steal passwords. It uses the Requests library to download the malware file from a specified URL, executes the malware on the target machine, and sends the stolen data to an email address controlled by the attacker.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the Requests library installed. You can install it using pip:

pip install requests OR python3 -m pip install requests


2. Adjust the `URL` parameter in the script to point to the location of the malware file you want to download.

3. Set up the email configuration:
- Replace `"Email@gmail.com"` and `"YourGmail-AppPassword"` with your Gmail account details in the `Server` function to configure the email server for sending the stolen data.
- Update the `to_addrs` parameter in the `Server` function to specify the email address where the stolen data will be sent.

4. Send the script to the target machine and execute it.
