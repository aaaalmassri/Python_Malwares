## Introduction
This directory contains two Python scripts for a simple ransomware attack. These scripts demonstrate how ransomware works, including encrypting target data and sending back the decryption key to an attacker's machine over a socket connection.

**Disclaimer:** The use of these scripts is illegal and unethical. This README is for educational purposes only. Do not use them for any malicious activities.

## Ransomware Script
The `ransomware.py` script is responsible for encrypting target data and sending the decryption key over a socket to the attacker's machine.

### Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Enter the safeguard key ('attack', 'start', 'encrypt') when prompted.
3. The script will search for target files with specific extensions on the 'C:\\' drive.
4. It will encrypt the files using a generated encryption key.
5. The encryption key is sent to the attacker's server.

## Ransomware Connection Server
The `ransomware_server.py` script is used as the attacker's server to receive the encryption keys from infected machines.

### Usage
1. Run the script on the attacker's machine.
2. It listens on a specific IP address and port.
3. When an infected machine sends the encryption key, the server receives it.

## Disclaimer
These scripts are for educational purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activities. Unauthorized use of ransomware is illegal and unethical. The author and OpenAI do not condone or support any illegal activities involving these scripts.

Please use this knowledge responsibly and ethically.
