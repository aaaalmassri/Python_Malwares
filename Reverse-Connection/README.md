# Python Socket Reverse Connection Scripts

Author: Abdelrahman Adel
Date: 2021

## Overview

This repository contains two Python scripts for creating a simple reverse connection between a client and a server using sockets. These scripts allow communication between the client and server over a network connection.

## Client Script

### Description

The `client.py` script is responsible for connecting to a server. It establishes a socket connection to the server's IP address and port number. The client can send and receive messages to and from the server. To disconnect from the server, the client sends the `!DISCONNECT` message.

### Usage

1. Modify the `HOST_ADDRESS` and `HOST_PORT_No` variables in the script to match the server's IP address and port.
2. Run the `client.py` script.

## Server Script

### Description

The `server.py` script functions as the server in the reverse connection setup. It binds to a specific IP address and port, listens for incoming connections, and handles communication with the connected client. The server can send and receive messages from the client and is designed to be interactive.

### Usage

1. Modify the `SERVER_IP` and `SERVER_PORT_No` variables in the script to define the server's IP address and port.
2. Run the `server.py` script.

## Note

These scripts are provided for educational purposes and may require additional error handling and security measures when used in real applications. When working with networking and socket connections, it's essential to implement proper security measures and error handling to ensure robust and safe communication.

Please use these scripts responsibly and in accordance with relevant laws and ethical guidelines.
